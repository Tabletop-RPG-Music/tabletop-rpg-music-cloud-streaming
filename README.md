# An Ever-Growing Library of Tabletop RPG Music (Cloud Streaming Version)

Help to support me write more music at https://www.patreon.com/tabletoprpgmusic

# Activate the module
After installing, as GM go to the `Manage Modules` options menu in your World Settings tab then enable the `tabletop-rpg-music` module.

# Usage

The Playlist will then show up under `Compendium Packs`

Open the tabletop-rpg-music folder in the Compendium and drag the playlists into the Audio Playlist section.

This version of the module streams music in from a cloud server, and so sometimes it can take a second or two before a track will start playing.
